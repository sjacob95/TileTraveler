Work with them images. Create walking/jumping images for each direction. Then implement the appropriate mathods.

It may be wise to give the Player a z-index so that it isn't drawn over during drawScreen since the player will be relocated rather than recreated.

There is a large deal of lag experienced through the drawScreen method. The method should instead be rewritten to redraw only the tiles that appear on-screen. This includes those tiles that extend past SCREENDIM, so additional calculations will probably need to be made in the initialize method to get both dimensions.

Entities will need to be drawn whether or not they are on-screen (in case they move on-screen).

Will an Entity map truly be necessary? maybe we just need an array since getter methods involving Locations may not be necessary.

An enemy that spits out a projectile in the direction it faces might be a good start for enemies.

All enemy/projectile death will be collision-based.
